I read thru the top habit books and a dozen or more reviews on Reddit and devised my own mnemonic... When I’m making habits for myself, I remember HABIT.

Habit : Explicitly state the trigger and behavior(s) you’re aiming for. Stack habits where you can with quick behavior first and enjoyable behavior last.

Archive : Set deadlines, benchmarks, and track your progress.

Backup : Have a plan for days you don’t have the energy. Aim for just ‘showing up’, and never miss twice.

Imitate : Manage emotional beliefs and triggers. Pretend to be the person who would have this habit.

Territory : Set specific times and places and prep your space to encourage or hinder your habit.

I hope that helps someone!

(Edit - Special shout out to the user that helped me spell out HABIT instead of REHAB! You’re the man, contigo-man)
