# Cách mình học từ [loại tài liệu học]

Có rất nhiều loại tài liệu học mà ở thời điểm hiện tại chúng ta có thể sử dụng được như: sách, video, podcast, sách nói, tài liệu PDF, v.v...

Cũng có nhiều phong cách học tập khác nhau. Theo như bài viết [8 loại phong cách học tập và các loại người học khác nhau](https://ahaslides.com/vi/blog/types-of-learning-styles/) thì chúng ta có 4 phong cách học tập chính và 8 phong cách học tập phổ biến. Phần tiếp theo mình xin phép trích dẫn từ bài viết trên:

## Hướng dẫn bắt đầu học cho các kiểu tài nguyên
Bài viết giả định rằng bạn đã biết về các kiểu tài nguyên này (Như sách, video bài giảng trên Youtube) và lợi ích gì đó. Nên mình sẽ không nhắc lại mà tập trung vào những gì mình *nên* làm để tối ưu hóa những gì mình có thể học được.

### Đọc sách textbook

Read out loud (even whisper to yourself ) so that you engage with the information in 3 ways simultaneously by seeing it with your eyes, speaking it with your own voice, and hearing it.

Read the chapter summary first. This will tell you what you’ll learn.

Read it out loud. This way you’re using the “seeing”, “speaking” and “listening” parts of your brain.

Anything that is highlighted in some way (ie bold text) is noted. Any other info that you feel is/could be important is broken down into bullet points in your own words. 



    Turn off electronics besides your phone with a timer (see pomodoro)

    Grab a notebook/ sheets of paper. Depends on how you like to keep/store notes, I used to do individual paper and put it in a binder, now I do spiral notebooks and put that inside a binder with other materials for the class.

    Read through the section once no notes. Second pass leave sticky notes where you don't quite understand the material. Different sticky note colors for different things is how I do it. Pass three is where I take notes, compress the knowledge.

    Turn to the problems portion of the book, begin to do problems just like (3), pass one is read, see how I'd do the problem. Pass two is an attempt, check different solution methods. Pass three is redoing the problem the right way after checking the numeric value answers (a =7), and finally seeing if my method was the one used to solve it in the solutions guide.

    Make an equations sheet, crib sheet, compact notes sheet.

Sidenote: for my higher level physics courses, I attempt to derive some equations here and there after I'm done with a chapter.


If I’m learning strictly from a textbook, first I read the section through once, and then I go back and read important parts of that section over, this time taking notes. You also need to work the example problems. I find this to be incredibly time consuming, but when I do it this way I learn the best (way better than a lecture)

It’s more discipline than anything. But other than that, if you’re watching your lectures on the laptop, put other distractions away (phone etc). Clear your table to minimise any potential distractions. I found actively taking notes during lecture help me focus more on the lecture whilst also providing me with something to do. Good luck! We can do this :)


Some things are understandable, some are not. I'm going through all theory first, If I don't get something - I'm watching specifically the part I couldn't understand. If there's no way you can do that - no one will judge you If you will skip some extremely obvious parts during the lecture. What matters is the end result. Then, with all theory in my hands at least for one topic I looked up at the problems that teacher explained. As I said, some things are easy to understand and some are not. I watch the difficult parts and skip some easy things.

Sometimes lecturer is explaining stuff in a super boring way. Everything depends but maybe then you should look up at some short and better explanation somewhere on the internet. 

go through the transcript of the lecture If there is any good one. 
Speeding up lectures probably my best hack and tip
-> Our goal when we watch lecture videos - capture only valuable info and understand what is going on on the slides. That is important, it will help us navigate with lecture slides later. When you watched a lecture, understood it, go through lecture slides and write down what needed

The tip I can give you about notes
- If you have everything on the slides, don't bother taking notes while trying to watch the lecture. 

When you're taking notes without a break and trying to understand the material you fail because it's impossible to do two things at once without falling behind somewhere. Our goal when we watch lecture videos - capture only valuable info and understand what is going on on the slide

Anyways my recipe is to watch lectures speeded up, skip some parts that I understand even looking at the lecture slides and keep my notes digitally If possible. Not sure If it works for everyone, but it literally saved me many times.


Take notes what you hear them say what’s not on the slides or what they spend the most time on for first pass. Rewatch and take notes looking at your old ones but more organized for second pass . Takes the pressure off the first pass. Second pass you already know the info so u can organize it however you want

Taking notes during the lecture, then perhaps rewriting your notes in a more organized way afterward will help. Then studying your notes

When you're listening to someone speak, repeat the words they say in your head as they're talking. For me, it engages completely different parts of my brain compared to just passive listening.

My method: read before class if there's any reading material(I rarely did this even when I did have reading material), listen to the class and take fast notes with a combination of my own understanding, what the text says, and what the professor said. Then while studying I go over those notes and write down from text plus my own notes again if needed. It took a long while to get to this solution

now for what are you looking to take notes on, if he said what's on the board textually you don't need that, if he is giving examples of explaining it with is own words, you take note. If he starts taking about examples, try to pay attention and see if that makes sense to you, if it does, take note of it, if it isn't, you don't. the objective is to have as much information as posible that doesn't repeat himself and is complementary to understand the subject, if you need more info to understand then you take more notes, if you get it with less info then that's all the notes you need. 


How I take notes;

Before class

-   Go look at the chapter, Wikipedia page, or a random YouTube video. Don't take notes just skim and get the vibe.
-   Your basically just convincing brain this is a cool topic and trying to be able to go oh that was mentioned before in class

In class

-   Online class, split screen with OneNote or Notion or whatever your taking notes on
-   Add-ons to make work for your class type, drawing or LaTeX for Math, code blocks for CS, sticky note to copy and paste stupid long hard to spell assholes name for Classics. That add on for Cntl Shift V no formatting on Microsoft office suite cause they suck
-   Also I like OneNote for inline math so mostly use it

Actually writing

-   Bullet points! MESSY bullet points
-   THE MOST MESSY ARCANE BULLSHIT BULLET POINTS
-   Use snipping tool to copy and paste code or charts. Use drawing tools if needed.
-   Use all caps and stuff like !!! to clarify what needs to go back to be explained more
-   Feel free to put ADD CHART SLIDE 7 HERE and keep taking notes
-   You can import PowerPoint slides into OneNote but often I find that's not super useful? I copy them in in another page.
-   For CS;
-   Copy and paste code and COMMENT THE FUCK OUT OF IT
-   Explain your Syntex and show syntax with code examples
-   Same idea for stuff like cmd prompts, explain what things are until you have it memorized or it's self evident. Ipconfig and ping are pretty obvious but you'll not hurt yourself explaining what -t is 3 times
-   Also a lot of this section of noting and explaining happens in the following section

Congrats you now have notes like,

-   Java Substring
-   Make smaller thing of thidgs
-   no thing make crash
-   Can go backwards or forward to end
-   see chapter 3.2 and link to docs
-   Something important about out of bounds?????

Fix your notes,

-   Alright now you have a bunch of gibberish. Congrats!
-   But you know the topics that need to be covered and have a general idea
-   Within 48 hours,
-   Sit down with notes and book / ppt open and maybe video or other source
-   Re-write this into sensible English and keep bullet points
-   Add in all those charts or code samples you missed
-   Find and note any questions you have now, if you can't immediately figure out the answer ask study group / teacher / whatever. Don't get stuck down a massive rabbit hole.

Mind maps can work well, I don't always like them but various whiteboard apps will likely help them look nicer.

For IT type stuff link your documentation and I would honestly copy and paste it into another page. Losing example tutorials on how you set up modded Minecraft in docker when you want to switch mods later is annoying af.

Also there's sites to transcribe audio from lectures which may help.

Edit: also you have to USE the info and have it easy to find. Stuff like Anki or flashcards or doing more practice work can help that. Fixing your notes up and good titles helps searching
